This directory contains Python scripts simulating problems from geometrical optics.  The Main Code folder contains the GeometricalOptics class used to create thin-lens systems.  The user can add lenses to the system and perform thin-lens calculations to draw ray diagrams, animate the rays' paths, and create interactive plots.  This class can then be called by the user in other Jupyter notebooks to simulate the problems found in the labs.
